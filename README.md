## Week 1 -[github page link](https://github.com/hsarfraz/DATA-1010-Introduction-to-Data-Analytics/tree/main/week%201)

[Here is a link to my published homework on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/hsarfraz76/1347104)

* tidyverse library
* ggplot package in the tidyverse library to create graphs
* variable types (categorical nominal, categorical ordinal, numerical discrete, numerical continuous)
* Dataset name: mpg dataset
* Dataset Size: 234 rows and 11 columns
* Any dataset cleaning: No
* Outputs produced (x-axis/independent variable & y-axis/dependent variable)
  * **Box Plot** (categorical nominal & numerical continuous) 
  * **Scatter Plot w/ regression line** (numerical continuous & numerical continuous)
  * **Scatter Plot w/ colors** (numerical continuous & numerical continuous) + categorical nominal variable for point color coding. But this variable is neither independent or dependent since we are just plotting variables and are not using a regression analysis

* variable types (categorical nominal, categorical ordinal, numerical discrete, numerical continuous)
* Dataset name: flights dataset
* Dataset Size: 336776 rows and 19 columns
* Any dataset cleaning: No (just filtering)
* Outputs produced (x-axis/independent variable & y-axis/dependent variable)
  * **Scatter Plot** (numerical continuous & numerical continuous)
  * **Scatter Plot** (categorical ordinal & numerical continuous)
  * **Bar chart** (categorical nominal & numerical continuous) 

## Week 3 [github page link](https://github.com/hsarfraz/DATA-1010-Introduction-to-Data-Analytics/blob/main/week%203/notes.md)

* week 1,2 libraries + scales library
* using the diamond dataset which is in the ggplot package from the tidyverse library

* Dataset name: diamonds dataset
* Dataset Size: 53,940 rows and 10 columns
* Any dataset cleaning: No (just filtering and visualisations)
* Outputs produced (x-axis/independent variable & y-axis/dependent variable)
  * **Scatter Plot w/ colors** (numerical continuous & numerical continuous) + categorical nominal variable for point color coding. But this variable is neither independent or dependent since we are just plotting variables and are not using a regression analysis
  * **Scatter Plot w/ regression line** (numerical discrete & numerical continuous)
  * **Bubble Plot**: (categorical ordinal & categorical ordinal)
   * **Heat map**: (categorical ordinal & categorical ordinal)
